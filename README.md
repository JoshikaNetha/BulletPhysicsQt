Thought for a couple of seconds


Here’s a sample **README.md** you can drop into your project root. It covers cloning, building Bullet3 with CMake, installing, and (for Qt/qmake) how to link against it in your `.pro` file.

````markdown
# Bullet3 Integration

This README explains how to fetch, build, and install [Bullet3](https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3), and how to link it into your CMake or Qt/qmake project.

---

## 1. Clone the Bullet3 Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/bulletphysics/bullet3.git
cd bullet3
````

---

## 2. Build & Install

```bash
# Create and enter build directory
mkdir build && cd build

# Configure with serialization support and shared libs
cmake .. \
  -DBT_ENABLE_SERIALIZATION=ON \
  -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON

# Compile using all available cores
make -j$(nproc)

# Install to /usr/local (requires sudo)
sudo make install
```

By default, this installs:

* **Headers** to `/usr/local/include/bullet3/`
* **Libraries** (`.so`/`.dylib`/`.dll`) to `/usr/local/lib/`

---

## 3. Linking in Qt/qmake

In your `.pro` file, add paths to the include and lib directories, and list required Bullet libraries:

```pro

INCLUDEPATH += /home/joshika/workSpace/QtProject/Repo/bullet3/src
INCLUDEPATH += /home/joshika/workSpace/QtProject/Repo/bullet3/examples
INCLUDEPATH += /home/joshika/workSpace/QtProject/Repo/bullet3/examples/CommonInterfaces

INCLUDEPATH += /usr/local/lib
INCLUDEPATH += /usr/local/include/bullet


LIBS += -L/usr/local/lib -lBulletCollision -lBulletDynamics -lLinearMath

```

---

## 4. Verify Installation

1. **Check headers:**

   ```bash
   ls /usr/local/include/bullet3/BulletCollision
   ```

2. **Check libraries:**

   ```bash
   ls /usr/local/lib | grep Bullet
   ```

3. **Sample run:**
   Create a minimal CMake or Qt project that includes a Bullet header:

   ```cpp
   #include <btBulletDynamicsCommon.h>
   #include <iostream>

   int main() {
     btDefaultCollisionConfiguration config;
     std::cout << "Bullet3 is working!\n";
     return 0;
   }
   ```

   Build and run; if you see **“Bullet3 is working!”** you’re all set.
